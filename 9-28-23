/*A 6-sided die is rolled a number of times and the results are plotted as a character-based histogram.

Example:

6|##### 5
5|
4|# 1
3|########## 10
2|### 3
1|####### 7
Task
You will be passed the dice value frequencies, and your task is to write the code to return a string representing a histogram, so that when it is printed it has the same format as the example.*/

  return results.reduceRight((histogram, repetitions, index) =>
      `${histogram}${index + 1}|${'#'.repeat(repetitions)}${repetitions ?
      ` ${repetitions}` : ''}\n`,'');
